# Credit Card Payment Default Prediction Model

Machine Learning Project

- Developed a machine learning model to predict credit card payment defaults using Python, achieving 75% accuracy and 0.53 F1-score on test data
- Implemented comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline including feature engineering, handling missing values, and categorical encoding using scikit-learn
- Utilized advanced machine learning techniques including CatBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, with hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian search
- Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis and feature importance analysis using SHAP values to identify key predictors of payment defaults
- Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline incorporating cross-validation, model selection, and performance evaluation metrics
